    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="p1">A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or
        other
        electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.The theory of general relativity predicts that a
        sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of no escape is called
        the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has
        no locally detectable features according to general relativity.In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal
        black body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that
        event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely
        proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes,
        making it essentially impossible to observe directly.</p><br>

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p class="jiw">The idea of a body so big that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by English
        astronomical pioneer and clergyman John Michell in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic
        calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that one would form when
        a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500,and its surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed
        of light.Michell referred to these bodies as dark stars.He correctly noted that such supermassive but
        non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible
        bodies.Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible 'dark
        stars'might be hiding in plain view,but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent
        in the early nineteenth century,as if light were a wave rather than a particle,it was unclear what,if
        any,influence gravity would have on escaping light waves.</p><br>

    <h3>Observational Evidence</h3>
    <p class="p3">By nature, black holes do not themselves emit any electromagnetic radiation other than the hypothetical Hawking
        radiation, so astrophysicists searching for black holes must generally rely on indirect observations. For
        example, a black hole's existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational influence on its
        surroundings.[150]

        On 10 April 2019, an image was released of a black hole, which is seen magnified because the light paths near
        the event horizon are highly bent. The dark shadow in the middle results from light paths absorbed by the black
        hole.[151] The image is in false color, as the detected light halo in this image is not in the visible spectrum,
        but radio waves.<br>
        The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is an active program that directly observes the immediate environment of black
        holes' event horizons, such as the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. In April 2017, EHT began observing
        the black hole at the centre of Messier 87. "In all, eight radio observatories on six mountains and four
        continents observed the galaxy in Virgo on and off for 10 days in April 2017" to provide the data yielding the
        image in April 2019.After two years of data processing, EHT released the first direct image of a black
        hole; specifically, the supermassive black hole that lies in the centre of the aforementioned galaxy.
        What is visible is not the black holeâ€”which shows as black because of the loss of all light within this dark
        region. Instead, it is the gases at the edge of the event horizon (displayed as orange or red) that define the
        black hole.<br>
